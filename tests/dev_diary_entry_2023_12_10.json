The plan involves creating seven unique templates, offering them for free, and providing detailed tutorials on their creation. Recognizing user preferences for convenience, the strategy includes merging these templates into a single, low-cost package. A significant addition to this strategy is the integration of AI, enhancing the templates' functionality and appeal. This approach balances educational value, user convenience, and advanced technology, aiming to build a broad user base and transition smoothly from free to paid content."
